\section{Method} \label{sec:method}
The social network presented here is based on an estimate of the many characters' connections in \got. The table follows Beniwal's approach and dataset \citep{beniwal_network_2018}, but includes positive and negative weights indicating a supportive or averse relationship. "Two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books" \citep{beniwal_network_2018} and characters with fewer than three interactions haven't been included either. The number of occurrences then is denoted as the weight of the tie, which is then rated by a "+" or "-". A "-" has only been used if the characters truly oppose each other, a positive attitude towards each other and a mere coexistence have been labeled as "+". Even if not all "+" relationships support each other fully, low support is also reflected in the number of occurrences. The table is structured as follows:

The network graph has been analyzed using \texttt{R} and the \texttt{igraph} package. The package offers the convenience to calculate the most important measures while also enabling complex plots.\\
The graph itself is a complete undirected one-mode network, all actors come from the same dataset.  Relations are modeled as co-occurences and attitudes. Different centrality measures will give estimates about who might be the most important character in the show. The cluster method used is a random walk cluster.
