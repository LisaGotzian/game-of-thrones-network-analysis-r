# Game of Thrones Network Analysis in R
Conducting a network analysis of Game of Thrones characters from the very first season to predict who will sit on the throne and who will die in the end.

The main plot in `Analysis_Game_of_Thrones.R` visualizes strength of relationships (# of encounters), quality (+/-), overall importance of the character as well as social clusters. The network analysis furthermore looks at the most important and central characters based on different centrality measures. `Paper_Game_of_Thrones.pdf` relates this point to quality of relationships.
